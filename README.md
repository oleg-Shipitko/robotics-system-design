# Robotics System Design 101
The collection of system design patterns and examples to conduct and prepare for Robotics System Design interview.

> **_NOTE:_**  This repo mostly focuses on **mobile robotics**, however some of the patterns are universal among various robotics domains.

## Table of Contents

* [Motivation](#motivation)
* [Autopilot](#autopilot)
    * [Perception](#perception)
    * [Localization and Mapping](#localization-and-mapping)

## Motivation

## Frameworks
### ROS
> **_NOTE:_**  Since ROS1 is going to be deprecated by 2025, we mostly discuss ROS2.

Overall design of the ROS2 is described on the [website](http://design.ros2.org) and [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07752.pdf).

#### Communication

#### Client library 

## Autopilot

### Autonomy 2.0

### Perception

#### Fusion
[9 Types of Sensor Fusion Algorithms](https://www.thinkautonomous.ai/blog/9-types-of-sensor-fusion-algorithms/)

By abstraction level:
- Low level - fusing the raw data
- Mid level - fusing the intermediate fusion results (e.g. detections)
- High level - fusing the tracks

### Localization and Mapping

### Prediction and path planning
#### Two layered path planning

- End-to-end prediction and path planning

### Simulators
- Handcrafted agents
- Learned agents polices
- Log replay
